## About

325studio is full service creative designed agency owned by Tony Naccarato, a product designer who specializes in branding, website design, application design, and user experience design. The company was established officially in 2007, but Tony has worked as a freelance designer for over 15 years working mostly with website design, user interaction, front-end development, as well as branding and print work.

325studio is located out of Davis County, Utah but services clients from New York to England.

Even though 325studio is mostly a solo freelancing company, depending on the project, the services of other designers or contacts are utilized to deliver the quality work that 325studio is known for.
